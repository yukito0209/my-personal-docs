## 🔧 Configuration

### Music Player

Place music files in the `public/music` directory. Supported formats:

It is recommended that music files are not too large to avoid long loading times for web playback.

### Gallery

Place image files in the `public/photos` directory. It's recommended to compress images appropriately for better loading performance.
We recommend using [Squoosh](https://squoosh.app/) to compress images into webp format.

### Documentation
